= cinch-lmgtfy

A simple plugin for the IRC-framework cinch to give lazy people a LMGTFY search.

== Requirements

The plugin requires a bit.ly[http://bit.ly] user and API-key and it also requires curl and ruby header files installed. 

On Debian based dists:

  sudo apt-get install curl ruby-dev
  
== Example bot

  require 'cinch'
  require 'cinch/plugins/lmgtfy'

  bot = Cinch::Bot.new do
    configure do |c|
      c.nick = "Cinchbot"
      c.server = "irc.freenode.org"
      c.channels = ["#cinchbots"]
      c.plugins.plugins = [Cinch::Plugins::LMGTFY]
      c.plugins.options = {
        Cinch::Plugins::LMGTFY => {
          "username" => "SOME_USER",
          "api_key" => "API_KEY"
        }
      }
    end
  end

  bot.start

To interact with the bot, just simply do

  !google LazyUser how can i find foo
